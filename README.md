## 🚀 Motivation

We wanted to explore mobile app development by creating a frontend for an **NFT Marketplace**.  
This was a chance to practice building real-world app screens and layouts for a Web3 concept.

---

## 🧠 What We Learned

- Developing mobile applications using **Android Studio** and **Java**.
- Designing UI/UX for mobile apps using **Figma**.
- Working with **dummy data** to simulate real-world functionality.
